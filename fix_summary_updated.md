# Discord Bot Database Fix Summary

## Problem
The Discord governance bot was failing to create proposals due to a mismatch between database schema and code. The code was using columns that didn't exist in the database:

1. `guild_id` column was referenced in code but missing in the database
2. `proposal_text` column was referenced in code but missing in the database
3. `id` column was referenced in code but missing in the database

## Solution
Created and ran scripts to:

1. Back up the database before making changes
2. Add the missing columns to the proposals table
3. Set appropriate values for the new columns:
   - `guild_id` = `server_id` (for compatibility)
   - `proposal_text` = `description` (for compatibility)
   - `id` = `proposal_id` (for compatibility)

## Scripts Created
1. `add_guild_id.py` - Added guild_id column and set values
2. `add_columns.py` - Added all missing columns and set appropriate values

## Verification
1. `test_fix.py` verified that proposals can now be created successfully
2. `test_proposal.py` verified overall database functionality
3. Manual testing confirmed all database operations working

## Root Cause
The issue likely occurred due to code changes that introduced new column references without corresponding database schema updates. Future database migrations should ensure that the schema stays in sync with the code.

## Recommendations
1. Add database schema validation at startup
2. Create a more automated migration system
3. Add comprehensive tests for database operations
4. Document the database schema and keep it updated
