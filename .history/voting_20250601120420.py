# the 100% vote check in process_vote (in voting.py). Putting it in voting_utils.py
# breaks the circular import between voting.py and voting_utils.py.
# Let's move the core calculate_results there and update it.

# The check_expired_proposals function should also be in voting_utils.py.
# close_and_announce_results should also be in voting_utils.py.

# We need to carefully manage imports to avoid circular dependencies.
# voting_utils.py should ideally contain pure functions for calculation and formatting results.
# voting.py should contain the interactive UI and vote processing logic.
# db.py should contain database interactions.
# proposals.py should contain proposal creation and management.
# main.py should contain bot setup, event handlers, and command dispatch.

# Let's refactor calculate_results and related functions into voting_utils.py
# And ensure imports are correct. The version of calculate_results that handles
# filtering abstain votes must be in voting_utils.py now.
