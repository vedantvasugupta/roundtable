# Active Context: Current Work and Focus

## Current Task

*   **Refining Proposal Creation Modals:** The immediate focus is on ensuring the proposal creation modals (`PluralityProposalModal`, `BordaProposalModal`, `ApprovalProposalModal`, `RunoffProposalModal`, `DHondtProposalModal`) are robust and respect Discord's UI component limits. This involves ensuring each modal, including its inherited components from `BaseProposalModal`, does not exceed 5 `TextInput` components.
*   **Memory Bank Update:** Updating all memory bank files to reflect recent fixes and current project state, particularly the changes to modal structures for proposal creation.

## Recent Significant Changes

*   **Modal Component Limit Fix (`ValueError`):**
    *   Refactored `BaseProposalModal` to contain 3 core `TextInput` components: Title, Options, and Deadline. The "Description" field has been removed from the modal UI; a default "No description provided." is now used.
    *   Subclass modals (e.g., `PluralityProposalModal`, `DHondtProposalModal`) now add their specific hyperparameter inputs, ensuring the total number of `TextInput` components does not exceed 5.
        *   `PluralityProposalModal` adds `allow_abstain_input` and `winning_threshold_percentage_input`.
        *   `BordaProposalModal`, `ApprovalProposalModal`, `RunoffProposalModal` add `allow_abstain_input`.
        *   `DHondtProposalModal` adds `allow_abstain_input` and `num_seats_input`.
    *   This resolved the `ValueError: could not find open space for item` and `ValueError: item would not fit at row X` errors.
*   **Hyperparameter Handling in Modals:**
    *   The `allow_abstain` input field is now consistently managed within the specific mechanism modals that require it.
    *   Mechanism-specific hyperparameters like `winning_threshold_percentage` (Plurality) and `num_seats` (D'Hondt) are also now correctly integrated into their respective modals within the 5-component limit.

*   **DM Voting Logic Implementation & Bug Fixing (Ongoing from previous state):**
    *   Added logic to `proposals.py` (`_perform_approve_proposal_action`) to send DMs to eligible voters when a proposal is approved. This includes fetching proposal details, options, eligible voters, calling `voting.send_voting_dm`, and recording invites with `db.add_voting_invite`.
    *   Addressed a `TypeError` in `proposals.py` related to `db.get_proposal_options` returning a list of strings instead of dicts (fixed in `_perform_approve_proposal_action` during DM preparation).
    *   Defined the missing `process_vote` function in `voting.py` to handle vote submissions from DMs and record them using `db.record_vote`.
    *   Fixed an `AttributeError` in `ApprovalVoteView` (in `voting.py`) by correcting the check for selected options from `self.selected_option` to `self._approved_options`.
    *   Resolved a `TypeError` in `ApprovalVoting.count_votes` (in `voting_utils.py`) by updating its method signature to accept `options` and `hyperparameters` and by initializing its results dictionary with all official options.

## Next Steps (Immediate & Short-Term)

*   **Thorough Testing (All Modals):** Verify that all proposal creation modals function correctly with the new structure and that hyperparameters are passed and stored as expected.
*   **DM Voting Lifecycle Testing (All Mechanisms - carry over from previous):**
    *   **Plurality Voting:** Full lifecycle test.
    *   **Approval Voting:** Full lifecycle test.
    *   **Borda Count & Runoff Voting:** Begin implementing and testing `RankedVoteView` and `count_votes`.
    *   **D'Hondt Method:** Verify DM voting and `count_votes`.
*   **Review `db.record_vote` and `process_vote` for Early Closure (carry over from previous).**
*   **Hyperparameter Utilization (carry over from previous).**

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   **Default Description Field:** The proposal description is now defaulted to "No description provided." in the database as it's removed from the modal UI. Consider if this is sufficient or if an alternative input method is needed for descriptions in the future.
*   **Early Proposal Closure (carry over from previous).**
*   **Clarity of D'Hondt Results (carry over from previous).**

## Important Patterns & Preferences

*   **Constraint-Driven UI Design:** Adapting UI components (modals) to respect Discord API limitations (e.g., 5 `TextInput`s).
*   **Iterative Debugging.**
*   **Memory Bank Upkeep.**
