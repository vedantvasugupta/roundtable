Vote Result Fix

This script contains improved versions of the functions that handle proposal
result announcements. It fixes several issues with the current implementation:

1. Better error handling to ensure results are always announced
2. DM notifications to all eligible voters when results are ready
3. Fallback to simpler messages if Discord embed fails
4. Better logging for debugging purposes
5. Handles both ID and proposal_ID fields properly
6. Includes vote counts in results

TESTING PLAN FOR SMALL SERVER (2 USERS):

This is a step-by-step guide to test the vote results announcement functionality
in a small server environment (2 users):

1. SETUP:
   - Create a test server with at least 2 human users
   - Invite the bot to the server
   - Ensure both users have permission to create proposals and vote

2. PROPOSAL CREATION:
   - User 1 creates a proposal with a short deadline (5-10 minutes)
   - Use simple plurality voting for the first test
   - Use options like "Option A" and "Option B"

3. VOTING PROCESS:
   - Both users should receive DMs to vote
   - Each user votes for a different option to test tie-breaking
   - Verify votes are being recorded by checking the database

4. RESULT ANNOUNCEMENT:
   - Wait for the deadline to pass
   - Verify that results are announced in the governance-results channel
   - Check that the proposals channel receives a notification
   - Verify that both users receive DM notifications about results

5. EDGE CASES:
   - Test with no votes cast
   - Test with both users voting for the same option
   - Test with a more complex voting mechanism (Borda, Runoff)
   - Test with very long proposal descriptions/titles
   - Test manually closing a proposal

6. DEBUGGING:
   - Enable verbose console output by adding print statements
   - Check the server logs for any errors
   - Use the test_proposal.py script to verify database operations

IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Copy the improved close_and_announce_results function to proposals.py
2. Copy the improved check_expired_proposals function to voting.py
3. Copy the improved close_proposal function to voting.py
4. Test using the plan above
